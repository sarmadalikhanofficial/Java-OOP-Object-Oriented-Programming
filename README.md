## üé® JavaFX Setup & Execution Guide

To run JavaFX-based programs, follow these steps:

### üîΩ Step 1: Download JavaFX SDK

Download the JavaFX SDK from the official site:

üîó [Download JavaFX SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

> üí° **Important:** After downloading, extract the JavaFX SDK to the following location on your system:  
> `C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Compile JavaFX Programs from Terminal

Use the following command to compile a JavaFX `.java` file via terminal:

```bash
javac --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml filedirectory\fileName.java

```
### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Run JavaFX Program from Terminal

Use the following command to run your compiled JavaFX `.class`:
```bash
java --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml fileName
```

# JavaFX Setup in Eclipse - Complete Guide

## Step 2: Configure Eclipse for JavaFX
1. Open Eclipse
2. Go to Window ‚Üí Preferences
3. Navigate to Java ‚Üí Build Path ‚Üí User Libraries
4. Click the "New" button
5. Enter a name like "JavaFX" and click "OK"
6. Select the newly created "JavaFX" library in the list
7. Click "Add External JARs"
8. Navigate to your JavaFX SDK lib folder (e.g., C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\lib)
9. Select all JAR files:
   - javafx.base.jar
   - javafx.controls.jar
   - javafx.fxml.jar
   - javafx.graphics.jar
   - javafx.media.jar
   - javafx.swing.jar
   - javafx.web.jar
10. Click "Open" to add the JARs
  
### For New Project:
1. File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Java Project
2. Give your project a name
3. Right-click on the project ‚Üí Properties
4. Go to Java Build Path ‚Üí Libraries
5. Click "Add Library" ‚Üí User Library ‚Üí JavaFX ‚Üí Finish
6. Click "Apply" and "Close"

### For Existing Project:
1. Right-click on your existing project
2. Select Properties
3. Go to Java Build Path ‚Üí Libraries
4. Click "Add Library" ‚Üí User Library ‚Üí JavaFX ‚Üí Finish
5. Click "Apply" and "Close"

## Step 5: Create a Sample JavaFX Program
```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.event.ActionEvent;
import javafx.event.EventHandler;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
 
public class JAVAFX extends Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World!");
        Button btn = new Button();
        btn.setText("Say 'Hello World'");
        btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
 
            @Override
            public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
                System.out.println("Hello World!");
            }
        });
        
        StackPane root = new StackPane();
        root.getChildren().add(btn);
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 300, 250));
        primaryStage.show();
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. If "Add External JARs" is grayed out:
   - Make sure you've created the User Library first
   - Select the library in the list before trying to add JARs

2. If you see red errors:
   - Verify all JAR files are properly added
   - Make sure you're using Java 11 or later
   - Clean and rebuild your project

3. If the program doesn't run:
   - Verify all required modules are added
   - Make sure your main class extends Application


## Important Notes
- In **Eclipse IDE**, your **project name** and **package name** must be the same.
- If you are copying code from **GitHub**, ensure that the **class name** matches exactly.
- Make sure you're in the correct **working directory** (i.e., the one containing Lab Manual Solutions) in the terminal.
- If your file uses packages, use dot . notation (e.g., package.name.ClassName) when running.

Follow these steps carefully to avoid any issues. üöÄ

# Library Management System - Presentation Slides

## Slide 1: Introduction
- Title: Library Management System
- Overview of the project
- Key features: Book management, Member management, Transaction tracking
- Built using Java OOP principles

## Slide 2: OOP Pillars Overview
- Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters/setters
- Inheritance: Person class as base class for Librarian and Member
- Polymorphism: Different behaviors for Librarian and Member classes
- Abstraction: Abstract concepts like Person, Book, and Transaction

## Slide 3: Person Class (Base Class)
- Base class for all users in the system
- Implements Encapsulation:
  - Private fields: id, name, contactInfo
  - Public getters for accessing data
- Used as a foundation for Librarian and Member classes
- Demonstrates Inheritance principle

## Slide 4: Book Class
- Represents a book in the library
- Implements Encapsulation:
  - Private fields: id, title, author, genre, isBorrowed
  - Public getters and setters
- Tracks book status (borrowed/available)
- Core entity in the system

## Slide 5: Transaction Class
- Records book borrowing and returning
- Implements Encapsulation:
  - Private fields: memberId, bookId, borrowDate, returnDate
  - Public getters for accessing transaction data
- Maintains history of all book transactions
- Demonstrates data abstraction

## Slide 6: Librarian Class
- Extends Person class (Inheritance)
- Implements Polymorphism:
  - Specialized methods for library management
  - Different behavior from Member class
- Key responsibilities:
  - Add/remove/update books
  - Register/remove members
  - View borrowing history

## Slide 7: Member Class
- Extends Person class (Inheritance)
- Implements Polymorphism:
  - Specialized methods for book borrowing
  - Different behavior from Librarian class
- Key features:
  - Borrow and return books
  - Track borrowed books
  - Limited to 5 books at a time

## Slide 8: Library Class
- Core system class
- Implements Encapsulation:
  - Private collections for books, members, transactions
  - Public methods for system operations
- Key functionalities:
  - Book management
  - Member management
  - Transaction recording
  - Search functionality

## Slide 9: Main System Features
- User Interface:
  - Separate menus for Librarian and Member
  - Interactive command-line interface
- Key Operations:
  - Book search by title/author/genre
  - Book borrowing and returning
  - Member registration and management
  - Transaction history tracking

## Slide 10: OOP Principles in Action
- Encapsulation:
  - All classes use private fields with public accessors
  - Data hiding and controlled access
- Inheritance:
  - Person class as parent for Librarian and Member
  - Code reuse and hierarchy
- Polymorphism:
  - Different behaviors for Librarian and Member
  - Same interface, different implementations
- Abstraction:
  - Abstract concepts like Person, Book, Transaction
  - Simplified complex system representation
