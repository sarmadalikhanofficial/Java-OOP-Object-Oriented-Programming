# Java-OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

This repository contains **Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** concepts, including classwork, assignments, and practice programs. As the **Class Representative (CR)**, I will ensure that all relevant codes and materials are maintained here for easy access by classmates.

## 📌 About
- Covers **core OOP principles** like **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.
- Includes **class lectures, assignments, and extra practice programs**.
- Helps students understand Java OOP with **real-world examples**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites

## Java & Eclipse Installation Guide

## Step 1: Install Java JDK
Download & install Java JDK from the link:
🔗 [Java JDK 23](https://download.oracle.com/java/23/latest/jdk-23_windows-x64_bin.exe)

## Step 2: Install Java JRE
Get Java JRE from the link:
🔗 [Java JRE](https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=251656_7ed26d28139143f38c58992680c214a5)

## Step 3: Install Eclipse Neon
Download Eclipse Neon from the link below:
🔗 [Eclipse Neon](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/neon/3/eclipse-java-neon-3-win32-x86_64.zip)

## 🎨 JavaFX Setup & Execution Guide

To run JavaFX-based programs, follow these steps:

### 🔽 Step 1: Download JavaFX SDK

Download the JavaFX SDK from the official site:

🔗 [Download JavaFX SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

> 💡 **Important:** After downloading, extract the JavaFX SDK to the following location on your system:  
> `C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\`

### ⚙️ Step 2: Compile JavaFX Programs

Use the following command to compile a JavaFX `.java` file via terminal:

```bash
javac --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml filedirectory\fileName.java

```
### ⚙️ Step 3: Run JavaFX Program

Use the following command to run your compiled JavaFX `.class`:
```bash
java --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml fileName
```

## Important Notes
- In **Eclipse IDE**, your **project name** and **package name** must be the same.
- If you are copying code from **GitHub**, ensure that the **class name** matches exactly.
- Make sure you're in the correct **working directory** (i.e., the one containing Lab Manual Solutions) in the terminal.
- If your file uses packages, use dot . notation (e.g., package.name.ClassName) when running.

Follow these steps carefully to avoid any issues. 🚀
